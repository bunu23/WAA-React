Write a React application with a component that contains a button. When you click the button an alert should be shown.Make sure the Button is in a separate component file, not is App.js.
Then modify the application so that the one single button component is shown 4 times.Every button click will show the same alert message.

Now modify the button component so that:
1. Every button has a different text.
2. Every button click shows a different message
3. Make sure you implement this with only 1 component, not 4 separate components.
